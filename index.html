      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the Eventano mobile application (“Eventano”, “the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information. 
        Eventano is created and operated by an individual developer (no company entity).
      </p>
      <p>
        By using Eventano, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account & Authentication Data:</strong> Email or identifiers issued by your identity provider, ID/access tokens, and related metadata required for secure sign-in.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> First name and last name you provide to personalize your experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Face Images (User-Provided):</strong> Face captures you submit to help the App find photos that include you. These are treated as sensitive data.</li>
      <li><strong>Photos & Metadata:</strong> Photos you upload or access through events, including photo IDs, URLs, timestamps, event IDs, and sharing status.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & Technical Data:</strong> Basic technical information (e.g., device model, OS version) necessary for app functionality and troubleshooting. No analytics are used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide core functionality: authentication, personalized photo feed, event subscription, and sharing controls.</li>
      <li>To maintain security, prevent abuse, and protect user data.</li>
      <li>To operate the service infrastructure (e.g., storage and content delivery).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Processing and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Eventano uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud provider to process and store data securely. Data may be processed in data centers located in regions where AWS operates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some processing occurs on your device (e.g., camera capture). Uploaded content (face images, photos, and related metadata) is transmitted over encrypted connections (TLS) and stored on secure servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal data (including face images and photos) for up to <strong>3 months</strong>, unless a longer period is required by law or is necessary to resolve disputes or enforce agreements. After the retention period, data is deleted or anonymized in our systems and backups on a rolling basis.
    </p>

    <h2>User Controls and Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access & Correction:</strong> You may view and update your profile details within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Sharing Controls:</strong> You can choose whether a photo is shared with event participants or remains private to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may delete face captures and photos you control within the App. For broader account or data deletion requests, contact us (see “Contact Us”).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> By uploading face images or photos, you confirm you have the necessary rights and permissions to process and share them as configured in the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Eventano is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Within Events:</strong> Photos you mark as shared may be viewable by participants of the corresponding event.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use AWS to host and process data on our behalf. AWS acts as a data processor under our instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
      <li><strong>No Sale of Personal Data:</strong> We do not sell your personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including transport encryption (TLS), access controls, and token-based authentication. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we work to continuously improve our safeguards.
    </p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside your state, province, or country. By using the App, you consent to any such transfers subject to applicable laws.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, when appropriate, notify you within the App.
    </p>
